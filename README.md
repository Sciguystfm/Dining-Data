# Dining-Data
A web service that pulls a user's dining transaction data off of RIT's eServices page, and visualizes the aquired data in the browser.

As a student at RIT, I am forced to use a school currrency known as "Food Debit" to pay for food on campus. From time to time, I'll need to stumble through the school's outdated and unintuitive website to determine how much I have left in my account. Fed up, I did a bit of research and discovered an API that allowed me to pull my raw dining transaction data and make something useful of it.

I created a web app that pulls a users data, and displays their current Food Debit Balance, and visualizes their data across: 
* A line chart showing Food Debit balance over time across two semesters
* A pie chart showing the users distribution of spent food debit across the schools resturants 

The user can focus on one chart, the other, or both at the same time, and they resize to fit.
